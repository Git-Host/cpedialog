= How to resolve? =

As cpedialog use appengine's [http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/indexconfig.html#Automatic_and_Manual_Indexes  automatic index generation mechanism], but the index can not be generated automatic in the production environment. *_I think this is a bug of appengine, you can only generate the index in your development enviroment firstly to resolve this issue_*:
  * Run cpedialog in your local environment to generate correct index.

  * Then deploy it to appengine server.
