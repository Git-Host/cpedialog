A alert message will pop-up to ask you whether to add a row. Click "OK", a default menu will be added to the table, then you can edit the default menu value directly.
  Click the default menu title and set it to "Albums", click the default menu permalink and set it to "*/albums*"(this value is very import, the system will access albums from http://your_site_url/albums, so make sure you have set the correct value), click the default menu valid column and set it to "true".
