= Why cpedialog is too slow when my laptop is behind a proxy  =
  * *Reason*
    * it is because the urlfetch model provided by GAE can't use proxy
    * by default cpedialog will request http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/json/tags/%username for delicious tag when you starup, so the urlfetch will hang your request.
    * [http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=544   	 urlfetch cannot be used behind a proxy]
  * *Solotion*
    * go to model.py
    * find variable delicious_enable
    * change the default value to False
= How to use log message when I develop =
  * use util.getLogger(__name__).debug($msg)
= i18n =  
  * *Preconditions*
    * Make sure you've installed Django. If not, go to _/google_appengine/lib/django_ and run _python setup.py install_.
    * Add _Python25/Lib/site-packages/django/bin_ to you system variable *Path*. 
  * *Wrap strings you want to i18n*
    * In .py file, you could use ,,-,,(). For example, use `response.out.write(_('hello'))` to replace `response.out.write('hello')`. 
    * In template file, you could use {% trans %}. For example, use `<span>{% trans "hello" %}</span>` to replace `<span>hello</span>`. Don't forget to add {% load i18n %} at the first line of the template file.
    * More detail information visit [http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/i18n/ here]. 
  * *Create locale files*
    * Make sure there is a folder named *locale* under root folder of project. If not, create it. 
    * Open command line prompt and change to your project folder. Run _make-messages.py -l language_, for example _make-messages.py -l zh_CN_. There is a file named _django.po_ under _proj/locale/zh_CN/LC_MESSAGES_.
